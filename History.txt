  Originally I wanted to use some data format like JSON.

  But requirement to quote key names and forbidden tail delimiters
  were too much for my taste of style. JSON5 is good. But I haven't
  written parser for it yet.

  So I decided to keep configs as Lua code.

    Lua code returning Lua table of course is overkill.

    It's security hole if you have no control over this file contents.

    But come on man, I'm doing this stuff for personal fun,
    not for someone who want to use this code for making money.

    Also I like ability to have several references to table.

    And I like data modelling.

  Similar thing in design intention is Makefiles. But there is
  ${syncrasy} and I have feeling I'm in US 1970s.
